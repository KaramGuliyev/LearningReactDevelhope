**React** is a library to build **user interfaces**. The main features of React are:
- Declarative: the UI is always defined as a function of its data, and will always update accordingly;
- Component Based: each element presented to the user is a component, from the smallest building block to the biggest UI element;
- Portable: it can power web apps, mobile apps or be rendered server side.

A **Library** is a tool that a developer can use to build an application, butdoes not necessarily care about all aspects of the application.
A **Framework** is an entire toolbox that gives a developer all the toolsthat are required to build a specific type of application.

The main building block and the essential part of React are **Components**. A component can be any part of the UI and it needs tobe able to do a certain number of things;
- It needs to know how to "draw" itself
- It needs to know how to react to inputs, if required
- It needs to be able to receive information from the outside
